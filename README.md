Mushroom classification

This project aims at developing a machine-learning algorithm that will determine if a certain mushroom is edible or poisonous by its specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. using different classifiers.

The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms includes descriptions of hypothetical samples belonging to 23 Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom species (1981). Each species is labelled as certainly edible, definitely toxic, or maybe edible but not advised. This last category has been combined with the poisonous category. The Guide claims explicitly that there is no straightforward criterion for determining the edibility of a mushroom, such as "leaflets three, leave it alone" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
The main objective is to figure out which mushrooms are harmful and which are edible.
